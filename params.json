  "body": "*Hello, I'm AwesomeBot. I add tons of cool stuff to any Discord server, providing external content, acting as a mod, and talking to members*\r\n\r\nThat's right! AwesomeBot is an all-in-one Discord bot packed with features, written in NodeJS and using the Discord.JS third-party API. Here are some of the things he can get from around the web:\r\n\r\n - Giphy links\r\n - Google Image Search\r\n - YouTube search\r\n - Reddit integration\r\n - Customizable RSS feeds\r\n - Full Wikipedia articles\r\n - Stock fetching\r\n - Google Play Store links\r\n - MSN Weather forecast\r\n - Wolfram|Alpha data\r\n \r\nIn addition, he has many built-in utility functions:\r\n\r\n - Natural language unit conversion\r\n - Random number generator\r\n - Discord user profile\r\n - Server game list\r\n - Reminders via PM\r\n - Year countdown\r\n - Stats for members, games, and commands\r\n\r\nAnd finally, AwesomeBot can conduct **in-chat polls**, offers a fun **live trivia game**, and provides **karma for Discord**. He is fully configurable via private message or online, and can be controlled independently between servers. New servers can be added simply by PMing the bot an invite link, and admins are automatically detected.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis repository provides the source for the already-running `@AwesomeBot` instance. You are free to use this code as a base for your own bot, so long as you follow the following terms as well as the license:\r\n\r\n1. If you modify the promotional message when the bot starts, you *must* add `-UNOFFICIAL` to the verison number on line 4\r\n2. You may **not** remove the credit to @BitQuote in the help section. If you wish, you may rephrase this along the lines of: `based on AwesomeBot <version> by @BitQuote`\r\n3. Join our private server if you are modifying the code in any way: [Join BotMakers, Inc.](https://discord.gg/0pRFCTcG2aIY53Jk)\r\n\r\nNote that I am very busy with work, so this repository will only be updated for milestone releases and development may cease at any time. Also, I know this project is *very* poorly written; keep in mind that I have spent embarrassingly little time on this.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Discord account for the bot\r\n2. Make sure you have at least one mutual server with the bot's account\r\n3. Clone this repository or download ZIP\r\n4. Get [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM if you need to\r\n5. Run `npm install` in the bot's directory to install the dependencies and then `node start.js` to get started! You will be prompted for credentials and settings.\r\n\r\nYou can PM the bot `config <server name>` to access the admin console for the bot in any server where you are the admin and just `config` to access the maintainer console.\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to make pull requests or open an issue on this repository. Any help is appreciated!\r\n",
